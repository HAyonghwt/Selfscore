## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm, inviting yellow-orange (#FFB84C) evoking the sun and natural outdoor environment. Its selection aims to avoid overly corporate or technical palettes that would feel alienating to elderly users.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated yellow-orange (#FAF2E7) to provide a soft, accessible backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: A gentle reddish-orange (#F26D4A), providing clear but non-jarring contrast. This should be used for interactive elements to ensure key actions can be found easily.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet friendly and highly legible appearance across various screen sizes.
- Use simple, high-contrast icons representing different actions and categories (e.g., player, course, score) to enhance usability, especially on mobile.
- Employ a clear, grid-based layout with sufficient spacing between elements to prevent clutter and improve visual scanning for elderly users, especially on the mobile referee interface.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as score updates or form submissions, but avoid distracting or excessive effects.
